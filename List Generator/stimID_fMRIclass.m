% makes a variable called stims that has the fields of faces, scenes,
% objects, and cues.  Each of those fields has a randomized array of stim 
% ID's (e.g., face13, cue130, etc).  The stimID's refer to the same images/words,
% across subjects (i.e., face13 is always the same person for every
% subject).  But the order of those stimID's is randomized for each subject
% so that the same images don't always appear in the same conditions.
% There's another script that calls the stims variable and it just
% sequentially assigns each stimID in the array to a set of conditions.
% That assignment procedure is not randomized for each subject, which is
% why the arrays here need to be randomized.  This script should also be
% run just once.  That's very important, otherwise you would overwrite the
% existing stims variable.  So, just for the sake of having a permanent
% record, I don't have this script called by anything else.  In other
% words, I'll run it once, save the stims variable and that's that.
